# Intro
This project is in an experimental phase as I learn TKinter and refine my use of Object Oriented Principles. The end goal is an application(or several) that syncs music and video clips in a satisfying way with the bare minimum amount of user input. 

For reference think about the cutting style of [this video](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrCDWX5JBCQ). Ignoring everything flashy, the technique for cutting could to follow 2 simples rules.

<ol>
	<li> Sync the most interesting part of a given clip with a particularly interesting climax of the song. </li>
	<li> Start and end clips at an interesting moment in the song, preferable, or just on any beat: generally.</li>
</ol>

If an algorithum is given timestamps, ranked by interest, of clips and music, it would be trivial to meet the requirements of these loose rules. 

It follows that this project should
<ol>
	<li>have a user designate and rank points in time by interest</li>
	<li>Have an algorithm create a video following a simple set of rules</li>
	<li>Give the user the option to tweek what the algorithm has made</li>
</ol>
